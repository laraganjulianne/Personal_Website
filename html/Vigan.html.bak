	<p></blockquote>Vigan is an island, which used to be detached from the mainland by three rivers – the great Abra River, 
	the Mestizo River and the Govantes River. It is unique among the Philippine towns because it is the country’s most 
	extensive and only surviving historic city that dates back to the 16th century Spanish colonial period. Vigan was an important 
	coastal trading post in pre-colonial times. Long before the Spanish galleons, Chinese junks sailing from the South China Sea came 
	to Isla de Bigan through the Mestizo River that surrounded the island. On board were sea-faring merchants that came to barter exotic 
	goods from Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax and other mountain products brought down by natives from the Cordilleras. 
	Immigrants, mostly Chinese, settled in Vigan, intermarried with the natives and started the multi-cultural bloodline of the Bigueños. </p></blockquote>
