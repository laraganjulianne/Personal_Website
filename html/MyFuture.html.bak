	<h1>MY FUTURE PLANS</h1>

	<div align="justify">
      <h4><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people have their own future plans, dreams, and other things they want to pursue some day. 
	  Everyone dreams about interesting jobs with good salary, a loving and supportive family, beautiful house and a lot friends. Future plans are 
	  often an escape from the usual lives for usMy plan after I graduate college is to have a month of break and after that, I will study forex 
	  trading with my partner, do a lot of practice and make a lot of money from it. When I make profit from trading, I will invest it again on 
	  stocks and on other legit and trusted investment companies so that my money will multiply and grow bigger and bigger as time goes by. One of 
	  my goals in the future is to not experience financial difficulties when I have my own family, house, car, and etc. that me and my partner will
	  spend on and I want our kids to study in an international school so that they will develop good characteristics and adopt competetiveness
	  in their school's environment and people around them.</h4></blockquote></div>


    <div align="justify">
      <h4><blockquote><div>When my money grow real big, I will spend a lot of time with my family, bring them to wherever they wanna go and treat them 
	  with whatever they want as I payback to them. If I have much money in the future I will also help the poor I think that we should help one 
	  another so that living in the society becomes more easy. I will also donate in places that were extremely damaged caused by natural calamities 
	  When I have children I will always try to help them in hard situations and give them advice every time they want. Like everyone I would like to 
	  be a good parent but I think it is very difficult to be a good mother because I’m short-tempered and I don’t have much patience but I think I 
	  can still improve it as I grow older. In my opinion, a happy family life should be connected with honesty, confidence and mutual help to 
	  achieve a stronger bond and relationship with them.</h4></blockquote></div>
