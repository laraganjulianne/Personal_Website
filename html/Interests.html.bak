	<h1>MORE ABOUT ME</h1>

	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<div align="justify">
      <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1.</sup>My <b>skills</b> are playing different sports like <i>volleyball, basketball, and badminton</i>. <sup>2.</sup>I'm a sporty person that i can play other different sports easily when taught to and because I'm a sports enthusiast. <sup>3.</sup>Actually the main sports I know how 
	  to play were just by myself watching over other people play live in our place and on youtube. <sup>4.</sup>I observe other people play different sports and I just buy myself the equipment I need in the sport I want to learn to play. <sup>5.</sup>I just practice by myself over and over again until I get the 
	  right basic positions and movements with the sport equipment i bought. <sup>6.</sup>I first got interested in playing basketball because that's the only sport I knew when I was a kid and often played by our neighbours and relatives. <sup>7.</sup>When we went to my mother's province, a lot of my relatives 
	  joined a volleyball contest and even my mother played there to. <sup>8.</sup>I saw how fun they played there and the people who are watching were very thrilled because almost all of the people who joined have age already and have difficult to move fast and easily get tired. <sup>9.</sup>I started to watch 
	  UAAP games when I was 12 and got really thrilled to play volleyball already so I practice a lot and play with my cousins and neighbours outside our house almost everyday. <sup>10.</sup>When I realize that my performance in playing volleyball improved, I decided to join the school's volleyball 
	  varsity team. <sup>11.</sup>I luckily got in the varsity team because they saw me play well already even if I still didn't have proper volleyball training. <sup>12.</sup>At my last playing year in gradeschool division, I got chosen by our coach to be the captain. <sup>13.</sup>My playing years continued in highschool 
	  until I finish senior high school. <sup>14.</sup>When I was I was an incoming grade 12 student, I joined a lot of outside volleyball leagues with different players. <sup>15.</sup>I learned a lot on the different leagues I played on and decided to try out in a school where my idol plays and luckily got in 
	  again and got a full scholarship so I enrolled there. <sup>16.</sup>My other skill s playing musical instruments like the drums and guitar. <sup>17.</sup>My father taught me to play the drums when I was little and through that, I developed my love for music. <sup>18.</sup>Whenever I listen to music, the beats stays on my 
	  mind and try to do the beat with my hands tapping anything that produce a sound, imagining that it's a drum. <sup>19.</sup>I also love to play guitar because the sound of it relaxes me. <sup>20.</sup>I can sing while playing the guitar even while doing fingerstyle.</p></blockquote></div>

   
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <div align="justify">
      <p><blockquote><div><sup>1.</sup>My <b>hobbies</b> are also some of the skills I have because I studied all of them to learn to do to them well. <sup>2.</sup>I keep my skills as my hobbies so I can continue doing them in my free times. <sup>3.</sup>My favorite hobbies are playing volleyball and guitar because there very convenient to do like I can play them anywhere
	  and anytime. <sup>4.</sup>Sometimes I play outside with my neighbour friends and cousins because it's more fun to play with a lot of people. <sup>5.</sup>I sometimes play guitar while watching tutorials in youtube when I'm alone so I can be entertained without being companied. <sup>6.</sup>I also listen to music and sing along when I'm tired doing something. 
	  <sup>6.</sup>I practiced a lot of songs through playing guitar, mostly the ones who were often sang by the people around me. <sup>7.</sup>Me and my friends jam together whenever some of my classmates brings guitar at school. <sup>8.</sup>My other hobby is playing online games like I can easily cope up with the game and master it so I can be a difficult and 
	  challenging component of other players. <sup>8.</sup>With my love of playing games, I gained a lot of friends there and they always count on me whenever we play as a team. <sup>9.</sup>We have a computer shop back then and I everday on summer, I play 15 hours a day because I'm free to play how long I want. <sup>10.</sup>I got very addicted to the game I played 
	  that time. Because of that, my eyes got blurred a little so I lessen my playing time. <sup>11.</sup>When I'm tired to play, I just scroll my timeline in facebook to watch and read funny memes and videos. <sup>12.</sup>I sometimes watch series and movies in netflix with my family. <sup>13.</sup>Mostly we watch about zombies and other horrors movies. <sup>14.</sup>I also love to 
	  watch war movies like the battles between different countries and fantasy like "Avatar". <sup>15.</sup>I sometimes play with my dogs when they seek for attention, like when they come to me and lick my feet. <sup>16.</sup>I love watching funny videos on youtube because they are compiled with lots of videos from other people. <sup>17.</sup>I play mobile legends 
	  sometimes when my friends ask me to so we can bond even when were not together. <sup>18.</sup>Most of the time, nowadays, I just chat with the person I love the most because it's the only way right now to express our love for each other since we live far from each other. <sup>19.</sup>I mostly talk with my love about investments and businesses. <sup>20.</sup>When
	  I'm tired to do anything, I just sleep when I have time after class.</blockquote></p></div>
    

	
	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<div align="justify">
      <p><blockquote><div><sup>1.</sup>My <b>interests</b> are also most of the things that I said in my skills and hobbies. <sup>2.</sup>My other interests that I haven’t stated yet are travelling, cooking and playing go to amusement parks. <sup>3.</sup>All of those are the things that I really want to do but I still can’t do those often because I don’t have money because of the pandemic. <sup>4.</sup>Among my interests that I have mentioned,
	  travelling is the one I want to often do especially with the person I love because it’s also what he wants to do to get away from stress and relax. <sup>5.</sup>For now we’re saving money and invest it so that in the future we can go wherever we want to. <sup>6.</sup>I want to go to japan because there are lots of beautiful places we can go and I want to experience living there even for a short period of
	  time. <sup>7.</sup>I also want to do adventures like hiking, riding a motorcycle up a hill and go to places I haven’t went on yet. <sup>8.</sup>I want to do cooking but at the same time I don’t want to waste money because I’m sure my first try will be a failure. <sup>9.</sup>All I do is watch how a food is prepared with its ingredients and how its cooked step by step and see how delicous it is by looks. <sup>10.</sup>I also watch 
	  Master Chefs and Hell’s Kitchen since I love watching cooking shows. <sup>11.</sup>When I get a job and earn, I will practice cooking a lot so I can cook for my loved ones as my payback for them. <sup>11.</sup>I want to experience the feeling of my loved ones tasting the dishes I will cook because I know that they will love it. <sup>12.</sup>My last interest I have mentioned was going to an amusement park because I really 
	  love to ride extreme rides and do carnival things with my friends. <sup>13.</sup>Going to amusement parks is going away from stress for me because I forget all my problems because of the fun experienced in amusement parks. <sup>14.</sup>One of my dreams is actually going to 6 Flags Magic Mountain in U.S because the rides there where very extreme. <sup>15.</sup>It’s would probably be the best experience in my whole life.  
	  <sup>16.</sup>For now, I’ll just stick to investing to make my money bigger. In addition to my interests, I also think of having different businesses when I have get enough money through investing. <sup>17.</sup>I want to build my own business not buying a franchise and have unique products that people will definitely go back for it. <sup>18.</sup>When my future business is successful, I will build other businesses to make a lot
	  of money. <sup>19.</sup>When I have a lot of businesses and investments, I'm gonna buy a lot and build my dream house. <sup>20.</sup>Lastly, buy my dream car and continue managing my businesses.</blockquote></p></div>
